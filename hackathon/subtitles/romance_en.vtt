1
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.884
Yeah, uh, hello. You're Steve?

2
00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:02.886
Steven. Steven. Hi.

3
00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:05.272
- Sit down.
- Roberto?

4
00:02:09.944 --> 00:02:11.820
- I'm all wound up,
- Yeah.

5
00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:15.407
You're wound up? I'm wound up too.

6
00:02:16.034 --> 00:02:17.576
- Yes.
- All wound up.

7
00:02:19.037 --> 00:02:21.655
- Ahh... What are you drinking... coffee?
- Coffee. Yes

8
00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:24.033
- νery good for me, coffee. For you?
- I love coffee.

9
00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:25.367
- You love it too?
- I Love it.

10
00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:26.918
- Steve!
- Steven.

11
00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:28.086
Steve...

12
00:02:29.338 --> 00:02:30.547
I love coffee.

13
00:02:31.424 --> 00:02:32.750
What do you do?

14
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.337
Oh, you know, I just relax, sit around,
maybe have a cigarette.

15
00:02:37.437 --> 00:02:38.317
Yes?

16
00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:40.841
Cigarettes and coffee,
I think go together good.

17
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:43.351
I don't know, you think
you drink too much of it?

18
00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.354
No. Coffee is good for health, yeah?

19
00:02:46.814 --> 00:02:48.766
I like to drink before I go to sleep.

20
00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:51.893
I drink a lot of coffee before I go to sleep.
So I can dream faster.

21
00:02:51.993 --> 00:02:54.779
I can dream, like when they put a camera
on the Indy 500...

22
00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:58.357
when they put a camera in the car,
and it's just whipping by like that.

23
00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:00.451
Dream after dream after dream after dream.

24
00:03:00.577 --> 00:03:02.236
People ask me the next day,
what did you dream about?

25
00:03:02.336 --> 00:03:05.623
I say, I don't have time.
I don't have time to tell you this.

26
00:03:13.548 --> 00:03:16.801
- Do you smoke?
- Only when I drink... coffee.

27
00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.220
Do you know my mother?

28
00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:23.682
- Do I know your mother?
- Yeah.

29
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.851
I don't know, I don't think so.

30
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.430
- Coffee. They should freeze it, you know?
- Yes!

31
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.768
Fill an icecube tray with coffee
and put sticks in it, for kids, you know?

32
00:03:33.868 --> 00:03:37.196
So they can start out when they're kids.
When they're playing, and stuff.

33
00:03:37.322 --> 00:03:40.233
Like a popsicle. A caffeine popsicle.

34
00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:43.243
Νery good. I don't understand nothing. Yes.

35
00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:01.052
- Can you hear me?
- What?

36
00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:03.130
Can you hear me? It's very loud over here.

37
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.016
You having trouble hearing me?
Maybe we should switch.

38
00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:11.354
Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to switch.

39
00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:15.525
Ahh, good here.

40
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:25.243
- Good?
- I kinda liked it better over there.

41
00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:28.280
- You go...
- Do you mind?

42
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.248
Yes, me, too. I prefer, yes.

43
00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:36.086
- Steve...
- Steven.

44
00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:37.296
Steve, yes.

45
00:04:49.851 --> 00:04:52.469
- When do you leave?
- The United States?

46
00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:53.540
No, here.

47
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.108
Here, oh... I have to leave, soon actually.
I have a dentist appointment.

48
00:05:00.278 --> 00:05:03.739
But I don't want to go.
I don't like the dentist.

49
00:05:05.658 --> 00:05:07.659
- Yeah.
- I gotta go. I guess.

50
00:05:08.703 --> 00:05:11.121
- Yes.
- I haven't gone in a while.

51
00:05:12.165 --> 00:05:14.958
Good. You don't go?

52
00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:19.922
- I should go, but I don't feel like going.
- No?

53
00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:27.386
Steve, I am free. Very free.

54
00:05:28.597 --> 00:05:29.931
You wanna go for me?

55
00:05:30.974 --> 00:05:31.949
Thank you very much.

56
00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:34.310
- You want to go to the dentist?
- I can go for you.

57
00:05:34.436 --> 00:05:35.436
Great.

58
00:05:36.772 --> 00:05:39.106
- Here's the address.
- Good.

59
00:05:40.108 --> 00:05:41.093
Good. Νery good.

60
00:05:41.193 --> 00:05:43.361
- The name of the guy.
- Yeah, 4:30.

61
00:05:44.446 --> 00:05:47.990
- Steven, thank you very much.
- No problem.

62
00:05:48.158 --> 00:05:50.284
- You don't mind?
- No, thank you.

63
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.286
Dentist appointment. Very good.

64
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.582
I have to go. I am sorry, Steve.

65
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.735
Steven.

66
00:05:57.835 --> 00:06:00.878
Steve, yeah I have to go to the dentist.
I am late.

67
00:06:01.296 --> 00:06:05.091
- Thank you, excuse me. Sorry...
- Take it easy, don't be late.

68
00:06:06.385 --> 00:06:10.054
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too, in a way.

69
00:06:54.724 --> 00:06:56.683
What are we doing in Memphis, anyway?

70
00:06:57.643 --> 00:06:59.636
- It was your idea to come here.
- Your idea.

71
00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:01.771
It was my idea? It was your idea.

72
00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:11.322
Very funny.

73
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.123
Don't smoke those sawdust cigarettes
in here.

74
00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:22.875
I hate those things.

75
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:25.044
- So what.
- What are you, a cowboy?

76
00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:28.589
- These are fresh. This is fresh tobacco.
- No, this is fresh.

77
00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:32.801
- This is the stupid dope fresh cigarettes.
- That stuff is stale. What are you, crazy?

78
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:37.348
- I'm not crazy.
- Shut up.

79
00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:43.562
How we doing here? Need a refill?

80
00:07:43.688 --> 00:07:44.730
- Yeah.
- No.

81
00:07:45.523 --> 00:07:46.523
Sir?

82
00:07:46.983 --> 00:07:48.359
- Yes.
- Oh yes.

83
00:07:55.283 --> 00:07:57.742
- Hey!
- Shit! I'm sorry.

84
00:07:58.118 --> 00:08:01.913
- Come on man, what are you doing, man?
- Damn, I'm sorry about that.

85
00:08:02.664 --> 00:08:05.625
Let's not even pay the check.
This place is terrible.

86
00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:09.087
This all you're going to have?
Just ahh...

87
00:08:09.254 --> 00:08:11.581
- Give me a light.
- Just coffee and cigarettes?

88
00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:13.257
That's not too healthy, is it now?

89
00:08:13.717 --> 00:08:16.094
- Can I get you a sandwich or something?
- No.

90
00:08:17.054 --> 00:08:19.430
- You all from around here?
- No.

91
00:08:20.724 --> 00:08:22.008
Are you brother and sister?

92
00:08:22.108 --> 00:08:23.226
- Yes.
- No.

93
00:08:25.813 --> 00:08:27.180
Are you two twins?

94
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.356
- Yes.
- No.

95
00:08:28.816 --> 00:08:29.941
Yes we are.

96
00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:33.686
I thought so.
You know y'all remind me of?

97
00:08:33.786 --> 00:08:36.239
- Who?
- Heckel and Jeckel.

98
00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:38.282
Shit.

99
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.953
You know ahh... the talking magpies?

100
00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:47.999
Anyway, who's the evil twin?
That's the way it works, right?

101
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.753
- This coffee tastes like mud.
- Really.

102
00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:56.466
Which one of us do you think
looks like the evil one?

103
00:08:57.635 --> 00:09:01.054
I'd say he's the evil one, right?
He's got the evil eye.

104
00:09:03.182 --> 00:09:05.183
- I'm only kidding.
- You better be.

105
00:09:05.768 --> 00:09:08.979
Hey, you know, I just thought of something,
with you two being twins and all.

106
00:09:09.856 --> 00:09:12.315
- Y'all go to Graceland yet?
- No.

107
00:09:12.483 --> 00:09:14.025
Oh, you should. It's real cool.

108
00:09:14.318 --> 00:09:16.695
- Mind if I sit down?
- Yes I do.

109
00:09:16.821 --> 00:09:19.489
Yes, you can sit down.
What are you, on a break?

110
00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:23.994
No really, but it's kind of slow.
Tell you what, you can help me out.

111
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.997
Just stay right there. You got me covered
and my boss can't see me.

112
00:09:29.667 --> 00:09:31.168
It's his evil nature, right?

113
00:09:33.045 --> 00:09:34.830
Well anyway what I just thought of.

114
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.549
Do you know that
Elvis Presley's got a twin brother?

115
00:09:38.008 --> 00:09:41.886
Yeah, his name is Jesse Garon.
You know, Elvis' middle name is Aron.

116
00:09:42.012 --> 00:09:45.965
Aron, Garon. Anyway, everybody thinks
he died at birth, you know?

117
00:09:46.065 --> 00:09:47.558
But my theory is...

118
00:09:48.018 --> 00:09:51.187
that his mother didn't wanna raise two kids,
you know, she wasn't expecting twins.

119
00:09:51.354 --> 00:09:53.397
She couldn't afford to raise them both,
she gave one away.

120
00:09:53.523 --> 00:09:54.682
She just sent one off.

121
00:09:54.782 --> 00:09:58.478
So he grew up, Jesse that is grew up
in Arkansas, or Mississippi, or something.

122
00:09:58.578 --> 00:10:02.364
So he didn't know he had a brother, Elvis.
But one day, like 1968 or 69...

123
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:05.784
...he's looking at himself in the mirror
and says, "Damn, I look like Elvis."

124
00:10:06.119 --> 00:10:08.537
So he comes to Memphis, looks up Elvis.

125
00:10:09.122 --> 00:10:12.374
Elvis sees him, he says,
Yeah, you're my brother. I can't believe it!

126
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:15.119
How you doing? What can I do for you?

127
00:10:15.219 --> 00:10:17.713
And his brother says, well I don't know.

128
00:10:17.923 --> 00:10:20.633
Sure would be nice
to be you for one night.

129
00:10:21.384 --> 00:10:24.837
So Elvis has this concert
where his brother sang.

130
00:10:24.937 --> 00:10:29.098
They tried to see if they could trick people.
And damn if he didn't sound like his brother.

131
00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:31.434
Then Elvis had an idea.

132
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.804
Well? I'm kinda tired of the music scene.
I'll send him out on tour.

133
00:10:34.904 --> 00:10:38.608
Big mistake! You see, cuz' it was his brother
who started to go to vegas...

134
00:10:38.734 --> 00:10:42.403
...and wear them big collars
and the white jumpsuits, and the capes.

135
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.115
Elvis wouldn't do that.
And it was his brother who got really fat.

136
00:10:46.242 --> 00:10:49.744
You know, eating those
banana-fried butter sandwiches and all.

137
00:10:50.287 --> 00:10:52.667
The Colonel said, man we gotta get rid
of this guy, you know?

138
00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:53.748
He can't be Elvis anymore.

139
00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:57.126
So they started feeding him pills.
I think they killed him.

140
00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:01.589
So what? What are you saying?
What's the punch line?

141
00:11:05.886 --> 00:11:08.263
- You all Elvis fans?
- No.

142
00:11:09.431 --> 00:11:10.431
Oh.

143
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.386
You want to hear something about Elvis?
I'll tell you something about Elvis, okay?

144
00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:17.514
- You ever heard of Otis Blackwell?
- No ma'am.

145
00:11:17.614 --> 00:11:20.566
- You ever heard of Junior Parker?
- No ma'am.

146
00:11:20.775 --> 00:11:24.486
Yeah, I didn't think so.
You know, Elvis robbed their music, man.

147
00:11:24.612 --> 00:11:28.240
He paid them ten bucks for their music,
and all these other black musicians, too.

148
00:11:28.992 --> 00:11:31.994
- That's what I think of Elvis.
- See now, here's where my theory fits.

149
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.454
I don't think it was Elvis.
I think it was his brother.

150
00:11:34.581 --> 00:11:36.832
Oh, so in that case, it's alright, huh?

151
00:11:38.918 --> 00:11:43.297
My favorite Elvis quote is, "The only thing
coloreds can do for me is shine my shoes."

152
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:49.469
I don't think The King said that.
See, I think it was his evil twin.

153
00:11:51.097 --> 00:11:54.224
Danny, what you doing over there?
You got tables to wait on. Come on.

154
00:11:54.601 --> 00:11:56.810
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, don't get fired, man.

155
00:11:56.936 --> 00:11:57.936
Danny!

156
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.397
Slap-happy hillbilly.

157
00:12:01.482 --> 00:12:02.482
Cheers.

158
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.863
Something smells funny in here.

159
00:12:11.074 --> 00:12:12.074
Hey!

160
00:12:13.827 --> 00:12:15.453
Is that my shirt you got on?

161
00:12:18.874 --> 00:12:20.041
No, I don't think so.

162
00:12:20.167 --> 00:12:22.668
Yeah, I think it is.
This doesn't smell like me.

163
00:12:22.794 --> 00:12:24.003
Yeah? What do you smell like?

164
00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:26.047
I smell like me,
and this doesn't smell like me.

165
00:12:26.173 --> 00:12:28.758
- I smell like me too.
- But this smells like you.

166
00:12:29.217 --> 00:12:30.885
That's because I am me.

167
00:12:32.054 --> 00:12:33.512
Is that my shirt?

168
00:12:33.889 --> 00:12:36.090
- Why are you always copying me anyway?
- No. I'm not copying you.

169
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.018
- Why don't you get your own style?
- I have my own style.

170
00:12:39.144 --> 00:12:42.688
No, you're always copying me.
Your style is my style, because you copy it.

171
00:12:42.814 --> 00:12:44.857
- It's my style.
- No it's not your style.

172
00:12:45.025 --> 00:12:47.518
Service is bad, coffee is bad, music sucks.

173
00:12:47.618 --> 00:12:49.020
Hey. Those are my shoes!

174
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.855
- Those are my shoes.
- Those are my shoes...

175
00:12:50.955 --> 00:12:53.157
- Those are my shoes.
- Those are my other shoes.

176
00:12:53.283 --> 00:12:54.283
Bullshit.

177
00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:45.992
- Hey.
- Hey Tom.

178
00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:48.670
- Alright...
- Alright, I'm glad you could make it.

179
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.331
- You are here.
- Yeah.

180
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:54.258
Yeah, hey you know you can call me Jim.

181
00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:58.887
I mean, you know, my friends call me Jim,
Jimmy or Iggy... or Jiggy.

182
00:13:59.013 --> 00:14:01.765
Call me J... Call me Iggy.
Call me Iggy. Yeah.

183
00:14:02.058 --> 00:14:05.936
OK. Alright, which ever way you go,
I'll go either way, Jim or Iggy...

184
00:14:06.271 --> 00:14:08.522
Iggy. You call me Iggy.

185
00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:13.736
Look, I'm sorry I'm late Jim.
Boy, whoo, four car pile-up.

186
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.690
I delivered a baby this morning at
about 9 o'clock.

187
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.034
I was saving lives,
I was out there on the highway, it was...

188
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.496
You know there's nothing worse than
roadside surgery.

189
00:14:24.622 --> 00:14:28.250
You know, you don't have your own tools,
and it's just, it's murder.

190
00:14:29.085 --> 00:14:32.629
I performed a tracheotomy
with a ballpoint pen...

191
00:14:34.799 --> 00:14:35.924
I've been busy.

192
00:14:37.969 --> 00:14:40.846
Wait a minute, you're a doctor?

193
00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:44.891
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a doctor.

194
00:14:46.143 --> 00:14:49.979
Music and medicine really,
it's really been my thing...

195
00:14:50.105 --> 00:14:54.567
...it's combining the two and
living in that place where they overlap.

196
00:14:55.819 --> 00:14:59.564
A lot of people say it shows up in the music,
you know, I don't know. I mean it's...

197
00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:01.324
- Well yeah, okay...
- Yeah?

198
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.451
- Yeah I can see that.
- Yeah. Yeah?

199
00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:05.328
Wow! Yeah, okay.

200
00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:09.616
I can... The organization and the whole thing.
And the humanity, I guess...

201
00:15:09.716 --> 00:15:13.286
The humanity of the thing. Sure.
The "regard."

202
00:15:13.386 --> 00:15:15.213
- Yeah. The regard.
- Ahh...

203
00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:18.007
Well I guess it was a big day for you then.

204
00:15:18.133 --> 00:15:19.717
Yes, it was a medical morning.

205
00:15:19.843 --> 00:15:22.261
- Everybody's alright?
- Everybody's fine.

206
00:15:23.806 --> 00:15:26.674
- Well...
- You've been here awhile, I see.

207
00:15:26.774 --> 00:15:29.761
Yeah, I've been here. Drinking a little coffee.

208
00:15:29.861 --> 00:15:32.188
- Yeah, I see.
- I ordered you some.

209
00:15:34.691 --> 00:15:35.899
You ordered for me?

210
00:15:37.568 --> 00:15:39.277
I mean, is it cool, is that cool?

211
00:15:40.321 --> 00:15:43.657
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Coffee, yeah...

212
00:15:44.784 --> 00:15:46.827
- I could go for coffee.
- Okay man.

213
00:15:47.203 --> 00:15:49.371
Come on, have some coffee. Yeah.

214
00:15:51.582 --> 00:15:53.750
Okay, coffee it is.

215
00:16:14.647 --> 00:16:15.981
Those your cigarettes?

216
00:16:16.232 --> 00:16:18.859
No. No, they were just sitting here
when I got here.

217
00:16:20.111 --> 00:16:22.813
- You don't smoke do you?
- Nah. I gave it up.

218
00:16:22.913 --> 00:16:24.648
- Me either. Oh boy.
- Enough of that.

219
00:16:24.748 --> 00:16:28.284
That was enough. 25 big ones. Oh boy.

220
00:16:28.577 --> 00:16:29.743
Finished.

221
00:16:29.995 --> 00:16:33.072
- Got the energy now.
- Ohh... I feel great.

222
00:16:33.172 --> 00:16:36.709
Boy, since I quit, I mean,
boy... just everything...

223
00:16:37.586 --> 00:16:38.582
Yeah, you're focused.

224
00:16:38.682 --> 00:16:41.630
- Zeroed in, bang! You know?
- Me too.

225
00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:46.594
I feel sorry for suckers still puffing away,
you know?

226
00:16:46.928 --> 00:16:49.722
- No willpower.
- No willpower. Pacifier...

227
00:16:53.393 --> 00:16:58.439
You know the beauty of quitting is that,
now that I've quit...

228
00:16:59.774 --> 00:17:02.359
...I can have one. Because I've quit.

229
00:17:05.614 --> 00:17:09.283
You know, I mean it's like jewelry...
you know, it's not really...

230
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.161
I don't even inhale really.

231
00:17:13.997 --> 00:17:15.539
You want to join me in one?

232
00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:18.783
- Well yeah, since I quit. I mean...
- Yeah,

233
00:17:18.883 --> 00:17:20.118
- Okay. Okay.
- Now that you've quit.

234
00:17:20.218 --> 00:17:22.003
- You can have one.
- Yeah,

235
00:17:22.129 --> 00:17:25.465
I can do that. Alright. Okay.

236
00:17:32.348 --> 00:17:34.599
Hey boy, thank you!

237
00:17:34.725 --> 00:17:38.353
You know what I mean?
Now that we've quit...

238
00:17:42.149 --> 00:17:46.235
Hey, cigarettes and coffee, man.

239
00:17:46.654 --> 00:17:48.321
That's a combination.

240
00:17:48.989 --> 00:17:50.156
Can't beat it.

241
00:17:53.202 --> 00:17:56.037
You know, we're really like the coffee and
cigarettes generation,

242
00:17:56.163 --> 00:17:57.664
when you think about it.

243
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:02.794
I mean, in the 40's,
it was the pie and coffee generation.

244
00:18:03.921 --> 00:18:08.257
Like Abbot and Costello on TV, man!
They always wanted pie and coffee.

245
00:18:08.925 --> 00:18:13.011
Yeah. Yeah, like Abbot and Costello!
They were always ordering pie and coffee.

246
00:18:13.137 --> 00:18:15.130
Have some coffee!
Have some pie and coffee!

247
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.848
What are you waiting for?

248
00:18:23.606 --> 00:18:24.940
You hang out here a lot?

249
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.362
Yeah. Yeah. This is my hangout.

250
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:35.242
Huh. I just wondered, because I didn't see
anything of yours on the jukebox.

251
00:18:40.248 --> 00:18:44.209
Well, I mean if you don't like it here...

252
00:18:44.961 --> 00:18:48.463
we could go down to Taco Bell or something.
Maybe that's more your style.

253
00:18:50.675 --> 00:18:52.551
What are you saying, man?
You saying, like,

254
00:18:52.844 --> 00:18:55.095
I'm like a Taco Bell kind of guy?

255
00:18:55.388 --> 00:18:59.465
No. I mean, if... you don't like it here,
you said, you don't like it here.

256
00:18:59.565 --> 00:19:01.892
No, no. I didn't... I didn't say that.

257
00:19:02.019 --> 00:19:04.303
We could go to
the International House of Pancakes.

258
00:19:04.403 --> 00:19:06.147
Maybe that's more up your alley.
I don't know.

259
00:19:06.273 --> 00:19:07.682
I didn't say that. I mean,

260
00:19:07.782 --> 00:19:10.401
I don't want to go to
the International House of Pancakes.

261
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.194
I'm comfortable.

262
00:19:21.621 --> 00:19:23.414
Coffee is good though, at IHOP.

263
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.000
Oh, you like the coffee down there at IHOP?

264
00:19:30.922 --> 00:19:34.709
I drink the coffee at IHOP. I like the coffee.
You don't like it?

265
00:19:34.809 --> 00:19:36.135
Yeah. Yeah, man.

266
00:19:36.428 --> 00:19:38.637
Hey, I like the IHOP coffee.

267
00:19:38.764 --> 00:19:42.099
- Classy brew. Classy brew.
- Yeah. Yeah. That's good coffee.

268
00:19:43.977 --> 00:19:46.312
Yeah, that's good coffee at the IHOP.

269
00:19:54.528 --> 00:19:57.655
Wow, wow, I almost forgot. Listen.

270
00:19:58.199 --> 00:20:00.784
I worked with this drummer
the other day in L.A.

271
00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.287
And this guy, man, his name is Giant Robo.

272
00:20:04.455 --> 00:20:08.283
And he's clangin' and bangin' and
really hard, Man,

273
00:20:08.383 --> 00:20:09.364
I thought of you.

274
00:20:09.464 --> 00:20:12.629
Maybe you wanna ch... This is somebody
I think you oughta check him out!

275
00:20:12.755 --> 00:20:13.755
Oh yeah?

276
00:20:15.466 --> 00:20:16.800
You mean, uhh...

277
00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:21.012
you think I need a professional drummer?
Like I'm not good enough?

278
00:20:22.098 --> 00:20:23.389
What are you talking about?

279
00:20:23.557 --> 00:20:26.885
No. No. I'm just... You know. It's a musician.

280
00:20:26.985 --> 00:20:31.314
I thought, I just wanted to tell you
about this guy. It'd be great, man.

281
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.486
It's like, hard, and industrial,
and he's beating, and I just thought, wow.

282
00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:43.325
What are you trying to tell me?
I need a drummer?

283
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.112
I could use a drummer?

284
00:20:46.212 --> 00:20:50.207
The drumming on my record sucks?
What are you saying?

285
00:20:56.005 --> 00:20:59.091
Ahh, forget it man. Forget it.

286
00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:34.284
You know what?
I think I really gotta get going.

287
00:21:34.384 --> 00:21:35.660
Oh you gotta go?

288
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.996
Maybe another cup?
Maybe another cig...

289
00:21:38.096 --> 00:21:42.667
Boy, I'd like to. No. No... Gotta go.

290
00:21:42.767 --> 00:21:44.510
I really gotta go. I mean...

291
00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:50.266
My wife, she's alone, in a motel.

292
00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:52.302
- Oh yeah...
- Yeah, you know...

293
00:21:52.402 --> 00:21:56.147
Call her up, come on down here,
have a cup of coffee, couple of cigarettes.

294
00:21:58.066 --> 00:21:59.609
- She doesn't smoke.
- Oh.

295
00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:02.353
- You know, it's the willpower.
- Oh I see.

296
00:22:02.453 --> 00:22:04.355
- I don't wanna start her...
- No...

297
00:22:04.455 --> 00:22:07.617
I don't want to get her started.
This is just our little thing here.

298
00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:09.243
Yeah, right. Yeah...

299
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.663
Well, hey, Just sorta...

300
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.241
We can just keep zippin' along, you know.

301
00:22:15.341 --> 00:22:20.205
I'll be thinkin'... I'll be thinkin' of ya'.
Gotta go.

302
00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:22.256
Well, I guess so. Well...

303
00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:24.257
See ya' soon.

304
00:22:24.383 --> 00:22:25.884
Yeah, okay.

305
00:22:26.594 --> 00:22:28.921
Wish you could stay a little longer.

306
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:30.597
Oh boy, I... I...

307
00:22:31.432 --> 00:22:33.767
We were just starting to get going here.

308
00:22:34.143 --> 00:22:35.435
Gotta go.

309
00:22:37.647 --> 00:22:40.440
- Okay.
- Okay Jim.

310
00:22:41.108 --> 00:22:43.276
- Next time.
- Okay, next time.

311
00:22:43.402 --> 00:22:45.654
- Take care.
- You take care too.

312
00:23:10.846 --> 00:23:12.472
He's not on here either.

313
00:24:13.198 --> 00:24:16.284
- You're a fucking moron, you know that?
- Now what?

314
00:24:16.702 --> 00:24:19.662
I can't believe that you're still smoking
those fucking things.

315
00:24:20.205 --> 00:24:25.251
Νinny, they'll fuck you up.
They'll kill you. Believe me.

316
00:24:26.045 --> 00:24:28.087
What, were you put on this fucking Earth
to annoy me?

317
00:24:28.213 --> 00:24:32.425
You said you were going to quit,
instead, you spend a fortune.

318
00:24:32.718 --> 00:24:36.046
So those big tobacco companies
can get fucking rich!

319
00:24:36.146 --> 00:24:37.714
And then you get cancer...

320
00:24:37.814 --> 00:24:41.768
And then the fucking doctors
and the hospitals, they can get rich.

321
00:24:41.977 --> 00:24:43.603
And the undertakers too!

322
00:24:43.937 --> 00:24:46.181
All because you want to smoke
like a fucking moron.

323
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:49.233
Well I can't help it.
I'm fucking addicted, okay?

324
00:24:49.568 --> 00:24:51.903
So coffee and cigarettes.

325
00:24:52.112 --> 00:24:55.406
That's your lunch? That ain't healthy, is it?

326
00:24:55.532 --> 00:24:57.908
You're drinking coffee
so don't break my fucking balls!

327
00:24:58.076 --> 00:25:00.952
Νinny, I had lunch already.

328
00:25:01.662 --> 00:25:04.414
So I'm on a diet, okay? Jesus!

329
00:25:08.836 --> 00:25:10.837
Here comes my freaking kid.

330
00:25:19.597 --> 00:25:21.932
Do me a favor,
don't tell your mother. Please.

331
00:25:22.683 --> 00:25:26.269
What the fuck am I talking about...
She smokes like a fucking locomotive anyway.

332
00:25:27.313 --> 00:25:28.647
How you doing Junior?

333
00:25:30.817 --> 00:25:32.351
He don't talk much, does he?

334
00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:35.987
Not lately. Lately he's been the silent type.

335
00:25:37.698 --> 00:25:40.450
I gave you 10 bucks last night,
so what'd you do with it?

336
00:25:49.793 --> 00:25:51.460
I just gave you 5.

337
00:25:55.465 --> 00:25:57.716
Listen, I'll give you 1 more. That's it.

338
00:25:59.594 --> 00:26:03.264
Do I at least get a hug? For 6 bucks,
do get a freaking hug?

339
00:26:03.807 --> 00:26:05.182
10 bucks for a hug?

340
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.093
You got to be out of your freaking mind!

341
00:26:07.193 --> 00:26:09.061
Alright come here, I'll give ya'...

342
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.608
You better go get yourself something to eat
and something good.

343
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.779
Yeah, just like him.
Get some coffee and cigarettes!

344
00:26:19.281 --> 00:26:21.323
Oh brother,
what the fuck are you talking about.

345
00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.159
Look at how much fucking coffee
you're drinking!

346
00:26:23.285 --> 00:26:25.369
You got the whole fucking pot
over there with you.

347
00:26:25.495 --> 00:26:26.495
So what.

348
00:26:26.746 --> 00:26:31.117
They always bring me a whole pot.
I like coffee. Keeps me going.

349
00:26:31.217 --> 00:26:33.502
Keeps you going, right.
You're a fucking maniac.

350
00:26:33.628 --> 00:26:35.087
A caffeine maniac.

351
00:26:35.338 --> 00:26:36.581
You're drinking coffee aren't you?

352
00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:38.215
- Yeah.
- So?

353
00:26:38.341 --> 00:26:40.091
So maybe you should try to quit.

354
00:26:40.468 --> 00:26:44.387
Hey, hey. I ain't no fucking quitter.

355
00:26:54.148 --> 00:26:55.773
Fucking moron.

356
00:26:56.358 --> 00:26:58.443
Aw shit, here comes my kid again.

357
00:27:02.698 --> 00:27:04.199
How much did you spend?

358
00:27:05.659 --> 00:27:07.744
And that's all you got for 4 bucks?

359
00:27:08.787 --> 00:27:10.872
Peas and something to drink for 4 bucks!

360
00:27:11.457 --> 00:27:14.542
- What the heck is in that bag?
- It's those Chinese peas.

361
00:27:16.337 --> 00:27:17.337
They're not?

362
00:27:18.506 --> 00:27:21.883
They're Japanese?
Chinese, Japanese. Same thing.

363
00:27:25.888 --> 00:27:26.971
Try one.

364
00:27:37.774 --> 00:27:40.901
Jesus Christ, tastes like black pepper!

365
00:27:41.069 --> 00:27:42.069
Give me those...

366
00:27:43.571 --> 00:27:46.156
Little bastard! Did you see that?

367
00:27:46.282 --> 00:27:47.783
He tried to fucking poison me!

368
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:51.987
No he didn't Joe. Listen to me.
Those things are very expensive.

369
00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:54.831
They're like a delicacy. A refined taste.

370
00:27:55.124 --> 00:27:56.833
Refined taste, my ass...

371
00:28:01.005 --> 00:28:02.839
Jesus Christ, not again.

372
00:28:04.133 --> 00:28:07.670
Now I can't even light a fucking cigarette
around here without getting fucking busted!

373
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.597
You know something?
You really are a fucking moron.

374
00:28:10.723 --> 00:28:13.767
I'm gonna get to those big tobacco companies,
and I'm going to thank them...

375
00:28:13.893 --> 00:28:16.228
...when they put you in the fucking ground.

376
00:28:16.938 --> 00:28:20.107
And did I ever tell that you're like a
fucking wife that I don't need.

377
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.611
Can't even enjoy a fucking cigarette.

378
00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.812
Excuse me Miss. Umm...
Can I get you some more coffee?

379
00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:44.314
Ahh,

380
00:29:45.691 --> 00:29:47.692
I really wish you hadn't done that.

381
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.780
I had it the right color, the right temperature.
It was just right.

382
00:29:55.534 --> 00:29:56.576
Sorry.

383
00:30:41.871 --> 00:30:43.871
Uhh... Hi.

384
00:30:48.044 --> 00:30:51.672
Sorry. Sorry about the coffee...

385
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.215
Sorry.

386
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.972
Does your name happen to be Gloria?

387
00:31:43.474 --> 00:31:44.474
No.

388
00:31:45.183 --> 00:31:47.517
Because I thought maybe you...

389
00:31:48.227 --> 00:31:50.562
You're not friends with umm...

390
00:31:53.191 --> 00:31:54.191
Sorry.

391
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:34.097
So, can I get you something else?
A sandwich, something to eat...

392
00:32:34.197 --> 00:32:35.816
...along with your coffee?

393
00:32:36.274 --> 00:32:40.027
It's not a very healthy lunch
just the coffee and cigarettes.

394
00:32:40.862 --> 00:32:42.696
It's not my lunch, okay?

395
00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:52.039
Sorry.

396
00:34:52.742 --> 00:34:53.742
Alex...

397
00:34:53.868 --> 00:34:56.161
You startled me.

398
00:34:58.247 --> 00:34:59.790
How are you, Isaach?

399
00:35:00.625 --> 00:35:01.625
Okay?

400
00:35:05.546 --> 00:35:06.630
Very well.

401
00:35:08.049 --> 00:35:09.674
I'm happy to see you.

402
00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:13.511
I was so sick of being in Paris.
You can't imagine.

403
00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:17.014
Sit down.

404
00:35:24.189 --> 00:35:26.857
So I was happy to get your call.

405
00:35:27.609 --> 00:35:30.027
A long time we didn't see each other. No?

406
00:35:32.531 --> 00:35:34.991
I ordered you some coffee. Okay?

407
00:35:35.117 --> 00:35:36.826
Oh yeah, sure. Thanks.

408
00:35:38.704 --> 00:35:40.287
So everything is okay?

409
00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:41.831
Yeah.

410
00:35:42.708 --> 00:35:45.960
Everything is okay. Very good.

411
00:35:46.837 --> 00:35:48.129
I am fine.

412
00:36:33.716 --> 00:36:37.302
So are you sure everything's okay with you?

413
00:36:37.595 --> 00:36:38.595
Yes.

414
00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:41.931
Everything is okay.

415
00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:45.310
And you?

416
00:36:45.895 --> 00:36:48.772
Me? Things are okay.

417
00:36:49.106 --> 00:36:52.274
Not perfect you know,
but pretty much okay, yeah.

418
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:56.278
Good. I'm very happy to see you.

419
00:36:57.405 --> 00:36:59.114
I'm happy to see you, man.

420
00:37:17.467 --> 00:37:19.968
It's just that since I didn't see you
for so long...

421
00:37:20.136 --> 00:37:22.012
...and you called to say
you wanted to see me.

422
00:37:22.263 --> 00:37:24.139
I thought maybe something was wrong.

423
00:37:24.474 --> 00:37:28.852
No. I just wanted to see you. That's all.

424
00:37:30.021 --> 00:37:32.981
Me too, man. I wanted to see you too.

425
00:37:44.493 --> 00:37:47.370
Are you sure there's nothing
you want to tell me.

426
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.330
Nothing bothering you?

427
00:37:49.456 --> 00:37:50.665
But why,

428
00:37:52.584 --> 00:37:54.502
do you want something to be wrong?

429
00:37:54.837 --> 00:37:56.212
Hey, not at all.

430
00:37:56.797 --> 00:37:58.005
But when I got your call,

431
00:37:58.132 --> 00:38:00.667
but I had an intuition that
something was bothering you.

432
00:38:00.767 --> 00:38:04.720
Something... maybe you need to talk about.
That's all, man.

433
00:38:04.847 --> 00:38:09.725
Isaach. There is nothing wrong. Really.

434
00:38:12.563 --> 00:38:13.563
Okay?

435
00:38:19.194 --> 00:38:20.361
Are you sure?

436
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:23.698
Are you crazy, Isaach?

437
00:38:31.373 --> 00:38:33.790
Are you sure you have nothing...

438
00:38:34.208 --> 00:38:37.002
to, you know, to let out?

439
00:38:40.882 --> 00:38:45.385
Should I invent something bad?
I could invent something bad for you.

440
00:38:45.595 --> 00:38:47.804
Not at all. No. No...

441
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:51.933
I don't want you to invent something.
You know, I'm your best friend.

442
00:38:52.351 --> 00:38:54.978
You should feel completely free
to tell me the truth.

443
00:38:55.229 --> 00:38:58.398
To tell me whatever it is bothering you.

444
00:38:59.066 --> 00:39:00.901
Cut the shit.

445
00:39:05.781 --> 00:39:09.701
Okay. Okay. I understand. That's cool.

446
00:39:11.495 --> 00:39:12.621
Thank you.

447
00:39:14.707 --> 00:39:15.916
Hey, no problem.

448
00:39:16.334 --> 00:39:19.044
Isaach, no problem.

449
00:39:42.859 --> 00:39:45.736
Well, I guess I'm gonna go.

450
00:39:46.446 --> 00:39:49.323
Really? So soon?

451
00:39:50.325 --> 00:39:54.119
Yeah, you know man,
if you don't want to talk to me about it,

452
00:39:54.246 --> 00:39:55.955
I don't want to be a problem.

453
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:03.128
There is no problem, Isaach.
Don't you understand? No problem.

454
00:40:03.338 --> 00:40:06.632
I understand. But listen.

455
00:40:07.759 --> 00:40:11.512
If you don't want to talk now...
Call me anytime, okay?

456
00:40:12.639 --> 00:40:15.682
Now maybe it's not the right time
for you, that's all.

457
00:40:33.117 --> 00:40:37.161
So, I was very happy to see you.

458
00:40:37.997 --> 00:40:42.583
Yes. Me too.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

459
00:40:43.002 --> 00:40:45.628
But there is nothing wrong. Really.

460
00:40:47.339 --> 00:40:48.673
It's okay, guy.

461
00:40:50.217 --> 00:40:51.551
I understand.

462
00:40:51.844 --> 00:40:54.929
No. You don't understand.

463
00:40:57.599 --> 00:40:59.017
Call me, Alex.

464
00:40:59.351 --> 00:41:00.727
See you, Isaach.

465
00:41:01.687 --> 00:41:02.687
Soon.

466
00:42:19.388 --> 00:42:22.973
- Hi... So nice to see you.
- Me too...

467
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.433
It's been ages.

468
00:42:24.559 --> 00:42:26.759
Yeah. Yeah.

469
00:42:28.021 --> 00:42:30.856
Last time was what?
A couple of years ago in Sydney, wasn't it?

470
00:42:31.024 --> 00:42:32.942
Really, was that 2 years ago?

471
00:42:33.193 --> 00:42:36.320
Wow. How are Jeff and Beryl?

472
00:42:36.488 --> 00:42:38.523
Oh you know, same old, same old.

473
00:42:38.623 --> 00:42:42.326
Still stuck in their odd little parental ways.

474
00:42:43.995 --> 00:42:47.456
So you're not with
Mr. Cate and the baby on this trip?

475
00:42:47.791 --> 00:42:52.752
Ahh... No. No. Unfortunately
I'm by myself. I'll see them next week.

476
00:42:56.632 --> 00:42:59.968
- Everyone's good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

477
00:43:00.761 --> 00:43:05.265
Yeah, I want a baby. At some point.

478
00:43:07.143 --> 00:43:08.427
What can I get for you?

479
00:43:08.527 --> 00:43:09.811
What you having Catie?

480
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:16.151
Oh umm... Can I have a espresso, please?
In a large cup.

481
00:43:17.486 --> 00:43:20.439
Yeah, I'll have an espresso too,
thanks. A double.

482
00:43:20.539 --> 00:43:23.275
And can I have some hot milk on the side?
And could you heat it?

483
00:43:23.375 --> 00:43:25.743
- I think we can manage that.
- Thank you.

484
00:43:31.167 --> 00:43:34.627
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know you haven't got a lot of time.

485
00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.007
Oh. Don't worry about it.
I wish I could stay longer.

486
00:43:40.258 --> 00:43:41.842
Do you stay here overnight?

487
00:43:41.968 --> 00:43:45.679
Or do you just do
your press stuff here? Your junket.

488
00:43:47.182 --> 00:43:49.349
Oh no. No, I stay overnight.

489
00:43:49.476 --> 00:43:52.686
And I do the interviews here too.
It's easier...

490
00:43:53.021 --> 00:43:55.355
I do my interviews in my suite,
in the room, upstairs.

491
00:43:55.482 --> 00:43:57.683
And I just thought they're setting up
for the next interview

492
00:43:57.783 --> 00:44:02.613
and I just thought maybe
it would be nicer if we met down here.

493
00:44:04.866 --> 00:44:07.951
No thanks Shell'. You're not...

494
00:44:09.704 --> 00:44:13.499
Oh go on.
They're not going to stop you smoking!

495
00:44:19.672 --> 00:44:21.715
- Here you go cous'.
- Thanks.

496
00:44:27.013 --> 00:44:29.806
So you mean, they give you
this full-on hotel suite,

497
00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:31.933
then they also use it for your publicity?

498
00:44:33.393 --> 00:44:34.393
Yeah.

499
00:44:34.811 --> 00:44:37.188
Seems kind of... cheap.

500
00:44:37.814 --> 00:44:41.901
Well, I mean, it's a suite.
So they just divide up the room.

501
00:44:42.027 --> 00:44:43.778
Yeah, but why couldn't they get you a suite

502
00:44:43.904 --> 00:44:46.697
and get another suite to do your press in?

503
00:44:46.823 --> 00:44:50.076
Well it's pretty low budget,
Shell', this thing I did.

504
00:44:50.452 --> 00:44:52.203
Yeah, still.

505
00:44:53.413 --> 00:44:54.872
Pretty cheap, man.

506
00:44:58.418 --> 00:44:59.585
Can I get you anything else?

507
00:45:00.128 --> 00:45:02.713
- No thanks, that's great.
- You're welcome.

508
00:45:07.553 --> 00:45:08.538
So umm...

509
00:45:08.638 --> 00:45:11.931
Kinda weird getting in here.
I almost didn't.

510
00:45:13.809 --> 00:45:15.726
Until they found out I was your cousin.

511
00:45:18.188 --> 00:45:21.940
There's some photographer-Paparazzi
guys hanging out front.

512
00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.360
I guess they kinda follow you around.

513
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:30.115
Oh you know, whatever so called
celebrities are around I suppose.

514
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.287
God that must be a real fucking drag
sometimes, right?

515
00:45:37.123 --> 00:45:40.834
Not like me, I'm free!

516
00:45:41.419 --> 00:45:43.503
Practically broke. But I'm completely free.

517
00:45:43.629 --> 00:45:46.089
No one's stalking me,
that's for fucking sure.

518
00:45:48.175 --> 00:45:52.846
Except when they thought I was you.
I got into this club once because...

519
00:45:53.723 --> 00:45:55.140
...they thought I was you.

520
00:45:56.475 --> 00:45:59.603
And then they found out I wasn't,
and asked me to leave.

521
00:45:59.812 --> 00:46:01.396
Pretty fucking rude.

522
00:46:03.858 --> 00:46:05.934
Don't get me wrong, it must be fabulous.

523
00:46:06.034 --> 00:46:09.195
You got it all. You got a good husband,
beautiful baby.

524
00:46:09.363 --> 00:46:12.490
Travel all over the world,
stay in fancy hotels.

525
00:46:13.783 --> 00:46:15.075
Parties...

526
00:46:15.827 --> 00:46:18.829
Yeah, well, you know what they say,
the grass is always greener.

527
00:46:19.706 --> 00:46:21.624
So how's umm...

528
00:46:23.543 --> 00:46:24.994
Shit ahh...

529
00:46:25.094 --> 00:46:26.170
- Johnny.
- Who?

530
00:46:26.296 --> 00:46:30.758
Jimmy... Tim... Tommy.
Sorry. How is he?

531
00:46:31.843 --> 00:46:32.843
Oh Tommy...

532
00:46:34.137 --> 00:46:36.430
We broke up almost 2 years ago.

533
00:46:38.224 --> 00:46:40.434
Tommy, Yeah. What a dickhead.

534
00:46:41.394 --> 00:46:44.813
Nah, got a new boyfriend now. Lee.
Remember?

535
00:46:46.107 --> 00:46:48.025
He's in a band. Wrote you about him.

536
00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.236
He's a pretty huge part of my life.

537
00:46:51.404 --> 00:46:54.281
Sorry, Shell', but I don't think you did.

538
00:46:54.574 --> 00:46:57.201
Yeah, I even sent you his fucking CD!

539
00:46:58.203 --> 00:47:00.371
Your assistant probably didn't give it to you.

540
00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.376
It's okay, it's totally cool.
I know how busy your life is.

541
00:47:07.836 --> 00:47:09.629
Do you remember where you sent it?

542
00:47:10.005 --> 00:47:14.042
No. I mean, one week you're in L.A.

543
00:47:14.142 --> 00:47:16.386
Then you're in London,
then you're in Sydney.

544
00:47:16.553 --> 00:47:19.555
I mean you're in a different fucking city
every day of the week.

545
00:47:33.153 --> 00:47:37.407
I'd love to hear the music.
What does it sound like?

546
00:47:38.742 --> 00:47:40.576
Well it's really...

547
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:43.621
kinda hard...

548
00:47:44.039 --> 00:47:46.749
...industrial, kind of throbbing...

549
00:47:50.379 --> 00:47:51.921
I don't think you'd get it.

550
00:47:55.883 --> 00:47:57.134
Well what are they called?

551
00:47:57.677 --> 00:47:58.927
They're called, Sqürl.

552
00:47:59.345 --> 00:48:00.512
Squirrel.

553
00:48:00.847 --> 00:48:03.598
No. Sqürl. You know, like they say it here.

554
00:48:03.725 --> 00:48:06.935
S-q-ü-r-I.
With an umlaut over the U. Sqürl.

555
00:48:07.562 --> 00:48:11.940
Oh Sqürl. I get it. Right.

556
00:48:12.316 --> 00:48:14.768
So I mean, can I buy the CD.
Until I find the one you sent?

557
00:48:14.868 --> 00:48:16.603
No. Well not yet.

558
00:48:16.703 --> 00:48:19.990
I mean, they recorded it
independently. You know, so...

559
00:48:20.116 --> 00:48:23.118
But I think the record company's
going to put it out. Finally. Yeah.

560
00:48:23.619 --> 00:48:24.661
I think.

561
00:48:29.751 --> 00:48:32.627
Well I'm going to have to find that CD
so I can listen to it.

562
00:48:34.255 --> 00:48:35.630
You're never going to find it.

563
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.426
Shell', that isn't fair. Actually...

564
00:48:39.677 --> 00:48:41.636
Well it's true. You're not going to find it.

565
00:48:41.804 --> 00:48:42.804
Really.

566
00:48:46.224 --> 00:48:49.518
Because I just remembered I didn't...

567
00:48:50.562 --> 00:48:51.854
actually send it to you.

568
00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:55.399
I think I just thought
about sending it to you.

569
00:49:09.581 --> 00:49:12.500
Oh, hey. Almost forgot.

570
00:49:13.627 --> 00:49:14.877
This is for you.

571
00:49:15.712 --> 00:49:17.838
Thanks. What is it?

572
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:24.428
Oh wow, this is really expensive stuff!
Must've cost hundreds!

573
00:49:27.516 --> 00:49:32.144
Yeah. Cool, thanks, yeah.
I could use this stuff.

574
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.731
Make me look like a movie star, right?

575
00:49:39.235 --> 00:49:41.694
- Cheers.
- Cheers, gorgeous.

576
00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:51.371
Seriously, Catie. Thanks for seeing me.

577
00:49:52.373 --> 00:49:54.541
Oh no, thanks for seeing me.

578
00:49:55.376 --> 00:50:00.046
And thanks for all the fancy swag.

579
00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:02.715
Oh, it's nothing.

580
00:50:05.594 --> 00:50:07.178
It is swag, isn't it.

581
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:11.474
They probably give you
all kinds of free stuff.

582
00:50:11.976 --> 00:50:16.563
Jewelry, clothes.
Probably give you cars, right?

583
00:50:16.856 --> 00:50:19.440
No, they don't give me cars.

584
00:50:20.526 --> 00:50:24.487
Yeah well they sometimes give me makeup
from time to time. But I just...

585
00:50:25.072 --> 00:50:27.407
...thought, I don't know, I just wanted...

586
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.158
I didn't have time to go shopping.

587
00:50:30.869 --> 00:50:33.453
No really it's fine, I mean,
it's great. I can use it.

588
00:50:34.414 --> 00:50:39.501
It's just funny, don't you think?
That when you can't afford something...

589
00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:41.912
...it's like really expensive.

590
00:50:42.012 --> 00:50:45.132
And then when you can afford it...
...it's, like, free.

591
00:50:47.218 --> 00:50:48.927
Kinda backward, don't you think?

592
00:50:49.929 --> 00:50:54.433
Yeah well, the world's a bit like that
I guess, in a lot of ways.

593
00:50:56.769 --> 00:50:58.645
Oh, speaking of paparazzi,

594
00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.273
I saw these photos of you the other day
in the tabloids.

595
00:51:01.399 --> 00:51:03.442
Oh don't tell me that. Yuck...

596
00:51:05.278 --> 00:51:06.612
What was I wearing?

597
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.322
Oh, sorry...

598
00:51:09.574 --> 00:51:13.702
Yeah? Hello? Hi Lindsey.

599
00:51:15.496 --> 00:51:19.041
Yeah, I'm downstairs,
in the coffee room with my cousin, Shelly.

600
00:51:20.834 --> 00:51:22.168
Already, really?

601
00:51:23.629 --> 00:51:27.965
Okay, yeah. Yeah,
I'll be up in a minute. Okay. Bye.

602
00:51:28.091 --> 00:51:29.508
- Got to get back to work?
- Yeah.

603
00:51:29.635 --> 00:51:31.218
Back to the grind.

604
00:51:33.972 --> 00:51:35.298
Do you want to come up to the room?

605
00:51:35.398 --> 00:51:38.100
It won't be very interesting
but I mean, you're welcome to come up.

606
00:51:38.727 --> 00:51:41.646
What, and watch you do
TV interviews and stuff?

607
00:51:42.022 --> 00:51:43.731
Like Entertainment Tonight?

608
00:51:46.985 --> 00:51:47.985
Yeah.

609
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:57.745
Yeah. Well maybe you can send me
that CD or a letter or something.

610
00:51:57.913 --> 00:51:59.413
Yeah, but you wouldn't read it.

611
00:51:59.623 --> 00:52:02.416
Oh stop it. I would if you actually sent it.

612
00:52:06.338 --> 00:52:07.622
- I've really gotta go.
- Yeah.

613
00:52:07.722 --> 00:52:09.215
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

614
00:52:09.716 --> 00:52:10.916
- It was great seeing you.
- Yeah.

615
00:52:11.016 --> 00:52:12.634
- Have you got my numbers?
- Yeah.

616
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:20.934
Oh take care.
Send my love to everyone.

617
00:52:24.021 --> 00:52:26.398
Yeah, send my love to everyone on your end.

618
00:52:31.654 --> 00:52:33.279
If they even remember me.

619
00:52:33.739 --> 00:52:35.865
- Bye Catie.
- See ya Shell'.

620
00:52:36.909 --> 00:52:39.619
Put that on my room,
and anything else she wants.

621
00:52:39.745 --> 00:52:42.080
Hey maybe next time
I'll get to meet Lou.

622
00:52:42.206 --> 00:52:43.456
Yeah...

623
00:52:44.458 --> 00:52:45.709
It's Lee...

624
00:52:54.093 --> 00:52:55.385
Ahh excuse me.

625
00:52:57.596 --> 00:53:00.390
Could I have a tequila, thanks.
A double. And the menu.

626
00:53:00.683 --> 00:53:03.142
I'm sorry,
there's no smoking in the lounge.

627
00:54:54.585 --> 00:54:57.754
So Jack, you going to tell me
about your Tesla Coil?

628
00:54:58.673 --> 00:55:00.507
You said you didn't want to hear about it.

629
00:55:01.342 --> 00:55:03.969
Yeah, I know, but that was awhile ago.

630
00:55:05.471 --> 00:55:07.430
Well, I don't know
if I want to talk about it.

631
00:55:10.935 --> 00:55:14.980
Come on Jack. You dragged it all the way
down here in your little red wagon.

632
00:55:15.523 --> 00:55:17.315
Come on, just tell me about it.

633
00:55:20.736 --> 00:55:26.366
Well I built it based on the inventor,
Nikola Tesla's original designs.

634
00:55:27.326 --> 00:55:28.869
It's an air transformer...

635
00:55:28.995 --> 00:55:32.873
...with primary and secondary coils
that are tuned to resonate.

636
00:55:33.833 --> 00:55:36.375
It's basically a step-up transformer...

637
00:55:36.793 --> 00:55:39.920
...which converts relatively low-voltage,
high current, to high-voltage,

638
00:55:40.046 --> 00:55:42.840
low current at high frequencies.

639
00:55:44.885 --> 00:55:47.128
Do you remember when we were kids

640
00:55:47.228 --> 00:55:50.264
you had a little Barbie makeup mirror?

641
00:55:51.016 --> 00:55:52.266
Yeah I remember that.

642
00:55:53.268 --> 00:55:55.227
Had a little fluorescent light on it.

643
00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:59.106
Well Nikola Tesla invented fluorescent light.

644
00:56:00.317 --> 00:56:03.060
Without him, we wouldn't have
alternating current...

645
00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:06.906
...radio, television, x-ray technology,

646
00:56:07.866 --> 00:56:11.493
induction motors, particle beams, lasers.

647
00:56:11.786 --> 00:56:13.746
None of that would even exist
if it weren't for him.

648
00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.665
Or the rock band, Tesla.

649
00:56:20.253 --> 00:56:21.253
Funny.

650
00:56:23.757 --> 00:56:25.466
Tesla was a true genius.

651
00:56:26.258 --> 00:56:28.259
If we would have paid more attention
to his ideas...

652
00:56:28.427 --> 00:56:32.972
The world would be a much better place.
We'd have free mass communication.

653
00:56:33.098 --> 00:56:36.009
Free transportation.
Free energy for everyone.

654
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:38.386
That's why they discredited him
in the end.

655
00:56:38.486 --> 00:56:39.771
For free energy.

656
00:56:41.857 --> 00:56:43.274
He perceived the Earth...

657
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.735
...as a conductor of acoustical resonance.

658
00:56:50.074 --> 00:56:51.449
What a beautiful idea.

659
00:56:55.955 --> 00:56:58.248
So Jack, are you going to show me
how the coil works?

660
00:57:00.626 --> 00:57:01.834
Yeah, alright.

661
00:57:05.422 --> 00:57:06.631
You'll need these.

662
00:57:35.326 --> 00:57:37.786
- Alright, you ready Meg?
- I'm ready.

663
00:58:08.817 --> 00:58:11.152
Damn it. Something went wrong.

664
00:58:12.446 --> 00:58:13.738
It was cool though.

665
00:58:15.282 --> 00:58:17.074
Yeah, but it wasn't supposed to stop.

666
00:58:17.242 --> 00:58:19.785
It was supposed to keep working.
I don't know what happened.

667
00:58:20.912 --> 00:58:22.705
Think maybe you blew a capacitor?

668
00:58:23.665 --> 00:58:25.875
No I didn't blow a capacitor, Meg.

669
00:58:29.087 --> 00:58:31.005
Maybe it tripped your GFI.

670
00:58:31.631 --> 00:58:33.799
Yeah, your "ground fault interrupter."

671
00:58:34.593 --> 00:58:37.595
Yeah I know what a GFI is.
That's not what happened.

672
00:58:38.722 --> 00:58:40.222
You don't have to snap at me.

673
00:58:56.156 --> 00:59:00.492
I think maybe your spark gaps are too far
apart on your spark coil vibrator.

674
00:59:08.042 --> 00:59:11.503
Ahh... Yeah that could be it.

675
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:14.714
I guess.

676
00:59:18.594 --> 00:59:22.764
Yeah, that is it. That's it.
You're right about that.

677
00:59:22.973 --> 00:59:24.599
I didn't check that earlier.

678
00:59:36.821 --> 00:59:39.906
Well I'm going to go home and check it out.

679
00:59:42.284 --> 00:59:44.111
Are you going to go bowling, tomorrow?

680
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:45.203
Yeah I'll be there.

681
00:59:45.303 --> 00:59:46.955
Alright, I'll see you there.

682
01:00:35.086 --> 01:00:38.172
Earth as a conductor of
acoustical resonance.

683
01:01:00.819 --> 01:01:04.606
Hello? Hello who is this?
Laura, hi, hi...

684
01:01:04.706 --> 01:01:07.366
This is Alfred Molina, for Steve Coogan.

685
01:01:08.368 --> 01:01:09.702
Alfred Molina.

686
01:01:11.622 --> 01:01:13.873
M-o-l-i-n-a.

687
01:01:16.001 --> 01:01:17.627
The actor, yes.

688
01:01:19.463 --> 01:01:22.048
Well I was just double checking
that Steve...

689
01:01:22.382 --> 01:01:24.217
...Oh he is. Great, great, great.

690
01:01:24.927 --> 01:01:28.554
Well just in case you need it,
my cell-phone number is... Hello?

691
01:01:39.065 --> 01:01:40.106
Hello, Alfred?

692
01:01:40.233 --> 01:01:41.733
Steve hello.

693
01:01:42.568 --> 01:01:45.820
Hi. Hi. I'm so glad you could make it.
Please sit down.

694
01:01:46.822 --> 01:01:50.859
I was just talking to Laura, your assistant.
...seeing if you were on your way here...

695
01:01:50.959 --> 01:01:52.486
- I'm here.
- Fantastic.

696
01:01:52.586 --> 01:01:54.704
I took the liberty of ordering some tea.

697
01:01:55.998 --> 01:01:57.415
Shall I be mother?

698
01:01:58.084 --> 01:02:00.710
That's okay, I'll be my own mother.

699
01:02:01.003 --> 01:02:02.629
Some milk there for you.

700
01:02:04.131 --> 01:02:05.924
- Real tea!
- Yeah...

701
01:02:07.134 --> 01:02:08.377
It's hard to come by.

702
01:02:08.477 --> 01:02:10.045
I have this fantasy...

703
01:02:10.145 --> 01:02:13.098
...if I ever won a Golden Globe or ahh...
an Academy Award,

704
01:02:13.224 --> 01:02:16.768
I'd use the opportunity to tell the Yanks
how to make a decent cup of tea.

705
01:02:19.063 --> 01:02:21.565
- Well here's to a good cup of tea.
- Cheers.

706
01:02:26.611 --> 01:02:28.946
I love your ahh... I love your coat.

707
01:02:29.948 --> 01:02:32.700
Yeah. Viv Westwood.

708
01:02:33.285 --> 01:02:36.996
I just... I like...
I've got a weakness for British designers.

709
01:02:37.122 --> 01:02:39.540
Yeah. I don't know
what it is about American designers.

710
01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:42.418
They're just too... safe.

711
01:02:43.461 --> 01:02:46.213
Aren't you going to be a little bit warm?
It's about 85 outside.

712
01:02:48.508 --> 01:02:51.794
- Yeah. No, I take it off when I go out.
- Oh.

713
01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:54.221
- It's just the air-conditioning.
- Right.

714
01:03:01.271 --> 01:03:03.431
So how long have you been living in L. A?

715
01:03:03.531 --> 01:03:05.816
Oh well, we've been here about 7 years.

716
01:03:05.942 --> 01:03:07.727
- Wow.
- We love it here. We just love it here.

717
01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:11.564
That's a long time. I do love visiting L.A.

718
01:03:11.664 --> 01:03:15.742
But I always say, it's a great place to visit,
it's an even nicer place to leave.

719
01:03:17.328 --> 01:03:22.749
The palm trees...
Palm trees annoy the fuck out of me.

720
01:03:23.542 --> 01:03:25.619
Yeah, well it's not for everybody.

721
01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:30.006
I like it here, but we came out here,
I came out here for the work and stuff.

722
01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:35.754
It's great to...
It's great to finally meet you.

723
01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:38.590
I got to say I'm a huge fan of your stuff.

724
01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:41.092
All the stuff you've done on TV,
the comedy stuff...

725
01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:43.728
I've got all... I've got all the tapes.

726
01:03:44.063 --> 01:03:46.773
You know, I get them sent over.
It's fantastic.

727
01:03:47.066 --> 01:03:48.107
Thank you.

728
01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:53.029
Yeah I'm ahh...

729
01:03:53.489 --> 01:03:58.818
you know, likewise...
I'm certainly very aware of you.

730
01:03:58.918 --> 01:03:59.918
Oh great.

731
01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:05.511
I saw that TV series you did.

732
01:04:05.611 --> 01:04:07.876
Oh yeah, you saw that?

733
01:04:08.586 --> 01:04:09.711
- Yeah.
- Wow.

734
01:04:09.837 --> 01:04:11.046
Interesting.

735
01:04:12.382 --> 01:04:14.549
- Yeah, we got cancelled.
- Yeah I heard that.

736
01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.762
Comedy's such a difficult thing.

737
01:04:20.306 --> 01:04:21.306
Yeah.

738
01:04:24.602 --> 01:04:26.395
Well your career seems to be
going terribly well.

739
01:04:26.521 --> 01:04:29.398
I mean, you've got a lot of heat
at the moment.

740
01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.149
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

741
01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:33.777
- Is that why you're here?
- Well you know...

742
01:04:33.903 --> 01:04:36.230
The merry-go-round of meetings.

743
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:40.200
It's nice, people are "finally"...

744
01:04:40.618 --> 01:04:42.903
...starting to take a bit of notice.
Which is great.

745
01:04:43.003 --> 01:04:45.914
- Are you meeting on anything interesting?
- Yeah...

746
01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:57.258
I've got to say you were just...

747
01:04:57.968 --> 01:05:00.928
fantastic in 24 Hour...

748
01:05:01.054 --> 01:05:05.474
No, seriously, 24 Hour Party People
was just a knock-out. I mean, brilliant.

749
01:05:05.684 --> 01:05:07.518
- Great work.
- Thank you.

750
01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.937
- Really brilliant.
- I was...

751
01:05:11.857 --> 01:05:13.232
And the reviews.

752
01:05:13.984 --> 01:05:16.277
They were pretty fuckin' great.

753
01:05:16.403 --> 01:05:18.904
I was amazed... because you know it was...

754
01:05:19.156 --> 01:05:22.692
I didn't think many people would get
all the sort of, cultural references.

755
01:05:22.792 --> 01:05:25.945
Sort of, Manchester, early 80's,
the whole kind of music scene...

756
01:05:26.045 --> 01:05:27.026
You'd be surprised.

757
01:05:27.126 --> 01:05:30.283
Yeah, but a lot of people really didn't have
any kind of reference to make to it.

758
01:05:30.383 --> 01:05:34.170
Because of the...
They know about the bands over here.

759
01:05:34.296 --> 01:05:38.458
But the whole thing, your character,
and his running the TV show...

760
01:05:38.558 --> 01:05:39.884
Do you want a cigarette?

761
01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:43.429
- Sorry, they're French.
- Oh, that's okay. Thanks.

762
01:05:50.102 --> 01:05:51.811
No. I'll save it for later.

763
01:05:53.355 --> 01:05:54.814
Oh, okay.

764
01:06:04.158 --> 01:06:07.068
Umm so, Laura said...

765
01:06:07.168 --> 01:06:12.332
...she said, that you were really
keen to meeting. Something she didn't tell me.

766
01:06:12.917 --> 01:06:14.417
She wouldn't tell me what it was.

767
01:06:14.668 --> 01:06:17.996
Well I didn't want to say it over the phone,
because it would've sounded weird.

768
01:06:18.096 --> 01:06:20.999
I can imagine how she thought,
this was coming out of nowhere.

769
01:06:21.099 --> 01:06:26.387
I phone her up, doesn't know me from Adam.
I must talk to Steve Coogan.

770
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.348
But I wanted to see you in person.

771
01:06:28.474 --> 01:06:30.391
When I found out you were going to
be here for a couple of days...

772
01:06:30.518 --> 01:06:33.520
...I thought this was the perfect opportunity...

773
01:06:33.687 --> 01:06:39.358
Anyway... I'll get right to it.
I'm so excited about this.

774
01:06:40.485 --> 01:06:42.402
Let me try and put it in context. I'm...

775
01:06:43.196 --> 01:06:47.491
I've always had a big passion for history.

776
01:06:47.826 --> 01:06:49.868
You know... and people's lives...

777
01:06:50.036 --> 01:06:55.123
...and all the little events of
how you get from A to B.

778
01:06:55.834 --> 01:06:59.378
And all the small details in people's lives,
are kind of really...

779
01:06:59.504 --> 01:07:02.172
...full of epic qualities. You know?

780
01:07:02.382 --> 01:07:04.967
So I've been doing all this research.

781
01:07:05.093 --> 01:07:09.805
Anyway, I... I've come up with this.

782
01:07:10.139 --> 01:07:15.477
And what state is... is it greenlit
or is it just a treatment? What stage is it in?

783
01:07:16.646 --> 01:07:20.808
I'm sorry no. God, how embarrassing...
It's not some...

784
01:07:20.908 --> 01:07:25.153
This isn't work, has nothing to do with work.
It's not you know, a project.

785
01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.115
What this is,
is I did some genealogical research...

786
01:07:28.241 --> 01:07:30.900
...and what I came across...
What I discovered was...

787
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.159
Mister Coogan?

788
01:07:32.411 --> 01:07:33.253
Yes?

789
01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:34.571
- It is you, isn't it?
- It is, yes.

790
01:07:34.671 --> 01:07:36.914
Oh umm... I'm such a huge fan.

791
01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.418
You're not that huge. Only where it counts.

792
01:07:41.962 --> 01:07:44.330
Could I bother you for an autograph.

793
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:45.915
- Absolutely.
- Great.

794
01:07:46.015 --> 01:07:49.927
I've been recognized.
Where do you want it?

795
01:07:50.304 --> 01:07:52.597
Oh, umm paper is fine.

796
01:07:52.806 --> 01:07:53.973
Spoil-sport.

797
01:07:55.392 --> 01:07:57.184
- Oh no, no. Don't do that.
- Sorry.

798
01:07:57.436 --> 01:08:00.438
- I probably have something in my bag.
- Okay.

799
01:08:01.064 --> 01:08:02.523
Give me a second here.

800
01:08:04.318 --> 01:08:06.611
Oh gosh. So sorry.

801
01:08:06.737 --> 01:08:07.737
It's alright.

802
01:08:09.615 --> 01:08:11.991
- Give me one more minute.
- Take your time.

803
01:08:12.117 --> 01:08:14.452
Here, please, in there.

804
01:08:14.578 --> 01:08:17.280
- Okay, and what's your name?
- Katy.

805
01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.457
- Katy.
- With a Y.

806
01:08:19.875 --> 01:08:22.167
Alright. What Katy did next.

807
01:08:23.502 --> 01:08:26.630
- Hello.
- Alfred's an actor too.

808
01:08:29.133 --> 01:08:31.551
- Here.
- Oh. Thank you. Great.

809
01:08:33.179 --> 01:08:35.513
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Never mind.

810
01:08:42.104 --> 01:08:44.648
- Wow...
- Well, let's get back to this.

811
01:08:44.774 --> 01:08:46.475
I don't want to take up
too much of your time.

812
01:08:46.575 --> 01:08:47.536
- I know you're busy...
- Sure. Yeah.

813
01:08:47.636 --> 01:08:50.812
As I said, I did this genealogical research.

814
01:08:50.912 --> 01:08:52.489
I was just doing it for my own interest...

815
01:08:52.615 --> 01:08:56.451
I wasn't looking for anything specific.
I just came across this.

816
01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:02.332
I'll cut a long story short. Steve Coogan...

817
01:09:03.501 --> 01:09:05.919
Drum roll. Umm,

818
01:09:07.129 --> 01:09:08.672
well the thing is Steve.

819
01:09:09.966 --> 01:09:13.008
You and I are cousins.

820
01:09:16.554 --> 01:09:19.723
How do you mean?
What... Do you mean artistically?

821
01:09:19.933 --> 01:09:22.226
No. No. No!
I mean in the normal way.

822
01:09:22.352 --> 01:09:25.145
We're cousins. We're related.

823
01:09:26.022 --> 01:09:27.022
Whoa.

824
01:09:28.358 --> 01:09:31.235
- It's amazing isn't?
- Yeah. I mean... Are you sure?

825
01:09:31.361 --> 01:09:33.529
See the way it works out is, look...

826
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:39.368
My great-great grandfather is
your great-great uncle.

827
01:09:39.661 --> 01:09:44.915
And further back, we shared the same
great-great-great grandfather.

828
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:50.379
Wow, yeah... my ancestry is Irish
but I knew there was an Italian...

829
01:09:50.505 --> 01:09:52.373
Well that's it! The Italian connection is

830
01:09:52.473 --> 01:09:55.134
our great-great-great great grandfather,
Giuseppe.

831
01:09:55.677 --> 01:09:57.336
- Wow.
- Isn't that amazing?

832
01:09:57.436 --> 01:10:00.973
This is a lot of detail.

833
01:10:01.099 --> 01:10:03.508
Yeah, well it's my thing. I kinda do a little...

834
01:10:03.608 --> 01:10:04.569
Amazing.

835
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:08.896
I think it's just great to say that
I'm related to Steve Coogan.

836
01:10:09.023 --> 01:10:12.817
Likewise, I can tell people
I'm related to Albert Molina.

837
01:10:13.068 --> 01:10:14.068
Alfred.

838
01:10:14.236 --> 01:10:15.236
Yeah...

839
01:10:16.238 --> 01:10:20.783
No it's my Grandmother...
...who's the big one on the family tree.

840
01:10:20.993 --> 01:10:24.245
She'll be very thrilled.
She's a huge fan of your work.

841
01:10:24.371 --> 01:10:26.330
She loved you in...

842
01:10:29.209 --> 01:10:30.209
Boogie Nights.

843
01:10:30.419 --> 01:10:32.795
Oh right! With the shorts and
the shotgun? Yeah.

844
01:10:33.088 --> 01:10:35.214
Yeah, she talked about that once.

845
01:10:36.133 --> 01:10:39.878
Great. Great. But you know...
I know this is coming right out of the blue.

846
01:10:39.978 --> 01:10:41.763
But just think of the possibilities.

847
01:10:41.889 --> 01:10:44.007
It's fantastic, listen,
let's look at the facts.

848
01:10:44.107 --> 01:10:48.603
We're both actors. We're cousins,
we've established that.

849
01:10:48.729 --> 01:10:51.314
We could... We could maybe work together.

850
01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.108
Do a play maybe.
We could make a... a movie.

851
01:10:55.276 --> 01:10:57.778
We could actually do a movie
about this story.

852
01:10:57.945 --> 01:11:00.898
About discovering this amazing thing
between us. That we're cousins.

853
01:11:00.998 --> 01:11:05.118
The story could be two actors,
who discover that they're cousins.

854
01:11:05.244 --> 01:11:06.870
We could actually play ourselves.

855
01:11:07.622 --> 01:11:12.501
We'd be in the movie, I'd be Fred Molina,
you'd be Steve Coo... We'd be cousins.

856
01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:15.796
In the movie. It's fantastic!

857
01:11:16.089 --> 01:11:18.465
It'd be great. Absolutely great!

858
01:11:20.093 --> 01:11:24.588
You know... or not. I mean, you know,
we could just hang out.

859
01:11:24.688 --> 01:11:27.641
Yeah, no, we should definitely go for a beer
sometime. That'd great.

860
01:11:27.809 --> 01:11:30.519
Maybe go on vacation together, you know.

861
01:11:30.645 --> 01:11:33.855
Just the two of us,
sort of, get to know each other.

862
01:11:40.988 --> 01:11:42.322
You're not gay are you?

863
01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:46.867
No. No. No, no. I'm... I'm married.

864
01:11:46.993 --> 01:11:49.161
Yeah, well, so was James the First.

865
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:52.998
Sorry. I don't know,
that popped into my head.

866
01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:54.667
Say it, get it out of the way.
Know what I mean?

867
01:11:54.793 --> 01:11:58.420
I understand.
I know exactly what you're thinking.

868
01:11:58.547 --> 01:12:00.506
If somebody came up to me going,
I'm your cousin...

869
01:12:00.632 --> 01:12:04.510
I'd think they were a nutter as well.
Take it from me, I'm not crazy.

870
01:12:04.678 --> 01:12:09.140
I just think this is a fantastic, extraordinary,

871
01:12:09.808 --> 01:12:11.392
delightful thing for me.

872
01:12:11.518 --> 01:12:12.431
Absolutely.

873
01:12:12.531 --> 01:12:14.687
- And I just wanted you to know about it.
- Ditto.

874
01:12:15.438 --> 01:12:18.858
All I want, if I want anything is
for you to just,

875
01:12:19.192 --> 01:12:23.445
acknowledge this extraordinary thing.
And...

876
01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.366
and just love me.

877
01:12:35.624 --> 01:12:37.876
Yeah. I could do that.

878
01:12:49.638 --> 01:12:52.838
I have to... go.

879
01:12:53.475 --> 01:12:55.560
I didn't tell you...

880
01:12:55.686 --> 01:12:59.014
...I have this meeting.
It actually moved forward.

881
01:12:59.114 --> 01:13:00.002
I see.

882
01:13:00.102 --> 01:13:04.235
It's at Universal.
Number crunchers, financiers.

883
01:13:05.404 --> 01:13:06.529
So umm...

884
01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.485
This... This... Is this ahh...

885
01:13:12.585 --> 01:13:14.196
- That's for you.
- Okay.

886
01:13:14.296 --> 01:13:15.296
It's yours.

887
01:13:16.457 --> 01:13:20.793
I'll make sure that gets filed.

888
01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.712
Sure. Sure.

889
01:13:23.047 --> 01:13:24.422
Well you're going to be here
for a couple of days, right?

890
01:13:24.548 --> 01:13:26.041
So maybe we could see each other
before you go.

891
01:13:26.141 --> 01:13:29.968
Yeah, ahh... Okay,
ummm... checking the mental diary...

892
01:13:34.432 --> 01:13:37.676
This is not... This is not good.

893
01:13:37.776 --> 01:13:42.105
The time I'm here. It's just backed up.

894
01:13:42.232 --> 01:13:43.166
- I understand.
- I'm backed up.

895
01:13:43.266 --> 01:13:44.087
Listen, no problem.

896
01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:47.945
Give me your cell-phone number and
I'll call you before you go.

897
01:13:48.071 --> 01:13:50.189
There's a story there... The... The...

898
01:13:50.289 --> 01:13:52.942
The... There's a tri-band system here
in the states.

899
01:13:53.042 --> 01:13:55.244
Which is different to...

900
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:58.080
...the system in the UK.
And it's a kind of... We...

901
01:13:58.498 --> 01:14:03.911
The cell-phones... they don't work here.
So I'm kind of cell-phone less, in the U.S.

902
01:14:04.011 --> 01:14:08.382
Oh I see. Well...
give me your home number, I'll call you.

903
01:14:08.716 --> 01:14:10.918
- You've got my PA's number, right?
- Yeah.

904
01:14:11.018 --> 01:14:12.719
Great, then we're connected.

905
01:14:13.346 --> 01:14:15.973
Well, can't... can't you give me
your number at home?

906
01:14:18.892 --> 01:14:24.355
Can I say no?
Because nothing, absolutely no...

907
01:14:24.773 --> 01:14:26.557
...nothing personal. It's just I don't...

908
01:14:26.657 --> 01:14:30.486
I never give my number out. Ever.

909
01:14:30.612 --> 01:14:33.864
It's just a space... personal space thing.
I never... It's just a rule...

910
01:14:33.991 --> 01:14:35.775
...and I always think, stick to the rule,
stick to the rule...

911
01:14:35.875 --> 01:14:40.496
You know, stick to the rule. And...
it's more of a philosophy than a rule, really.

912
01:14:40.664 --> 01:14:46.168
I can say...
I've not given my number out to many...

913
01:14:46.586 --> 01:14:47.712
...eminent people in the past.

914
01:14:47.838 --> 01:14:52.091
I once didn't give my number to Sam Mendes.
So you're in good company.

915
01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:58.014
Well if it's good enough for Sam Mendes,
it's good enough for me.

916
01:14:58.974 --> 01:14:59.974
Yeah.

917
01:15:03.979 --> 01:15:06.848
- I think it's me.
- Oh that's right. Mine doesn't work.

918
01:15:06.948 --> 01:15:08.773
I'm sorry, I got to take this...

919
01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:11.860
Hello?

920
01:15:13.029 --> 01:15:14.654
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

921
01:15:16.741 --> 01:15:20.368
Spike, hi... How you doing?

922
01:15:20.536 --> 01:15:21.945
Yeah, you got the message.

923
01:15:22.045 --> 01:15:26.207
My agent just called you, just to
make sure we're all on the same page.

924
01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:30.712
No the producer credit is just so
you and I...

925
01:15:31.047 --> 01:15:32.547
Can sort of keep tabs on everything,

926
01:15:32.673 --> 01:15:34.591
you know, artistic integrity,
all that sort of thing.

927
01:15:34.717 --> 01:15:36.468
Otherwise the whole thing
could just run away.

928
01:15:40.723 --> 01:15:44.392
Oh you bastard, no... Alright.

929
01:15:45.061 --> 01:15:47.479
Yeah, you still okay for Sunday?
Good, alright.

930
01:15:47.688 --> 01:15:49.731
Will I meet you there? Alright.

931
01:15:49.982 --> 01:15:53.193
Nice and early. Okay yeah, yeah.
Lots of love.

932
01:15:53.319 --> 01:15:54.569
Bye, bye Spike.

933
01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:58.573
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay, okay... Fine. Fine.

934
01:15:59.116 --> 01:16:01.283
So... Umm... You... Was...

935
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:03.986
Was that Spike Lee?

936
01:16:04.086 --> 01:16:06.989
Oh no, no, no.
I don't even know Spike Lee.

937
01:16:07.089 --> 01:16:08.415
No, that was Spike Jonze.

938
01:16:08.541 --> 01:16:09.958
- Spike Jonze!
- Yeah.

939
01:16:10.085 --> 01:16:13.212
- I love him!
- Yeah, he's a good man. Good man, Spike.

940
01:16:13.421 --> 01:16:16.590
Yeah, we've been...
We've been friends for a long, long time now.

941
01:16:16.966 --> 01:16:20.878
We're both keen hikers, We've...
Well, it's very boring.

942
01:16:20.978 --> 01:16:22.429
No, no, no, go on.

943
01:16:22.931 --> 01:16:27.267
Well we belong to a club.
And we go hiking on weekends.

944
01:16:27.394 --> 01:16:31.722
He's a very, very, very committed
environmentalist.

945
01:16:31.822 --> 01:16:33.649
Spike Jonze is a tree-hugger...

946
01:16:33.775 --> 01:16:35.943
Jesus, I never had him down as that.

947
01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:43.200
Well, I think he prefers the term,
leaf-people.

948
01:16:43.785 --> 01:16:45.385
As do I.

949
01:16:48.706 --> 01:16:51.741
Right, yeah, no... I mean, that's...
Don't get me wrong...

950
01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:56.295
...I think it's great, I love trees.
I think there should be...

951
01:16:57.005 --> 01:17:01.634
there should be more of them.
When I use paper, I use both sides.

952
01:17:02.386 --> 01:17:05.221
Umm... I would love to...

953
01:17:10.644 --> 01:17:15.022
You know, I'm going to tear up
that stupid rule about

954
01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:19.485
phone numbers and... It's such shit.

955
01:17:21.655 --> 01:17:24.574
Would it be shabby of me
to give you my number now?

956
01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.120
Yeah.

957
01:17:31.457 --> 01:17:32.457
Okay.

958
01:17:34.209 --> 01:17:36.409
Okay. Okay.

959
01:17:39.173 --> 01:17:42.215
I've... I've got to go. I'm so sorry.

960
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:47.179
- I'll get the check.
- Good.

961
01:18:00.526 --> 01:18:01.526
Fuck...

962
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:42.107
Damn RZA, where the fuck you at?

963
01:18:54.746 --> 01:18:57.748
- Yo, yo, yo. Peace, yo.
- Bobby...

964
01:18:57.874 --> 01:18:59.959
- Word, man. Word, word.
- Chill.

965
01:19:01.086 --> 01:19:02.411
Pardon me for being late, Fam'.

966
01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:04.205
Ain't nothing man, I was about
to hit you on the horn.

967
01:19:04.305 --> 01:19:06.590
Yeah, I had a fucking
emergency house call, yo.

968
01:19:07.050 --> 01:19:09.760
- House call?
- Yeah, house call.

969
01:19:09.928 --> 01:19:13.339
Sophia and Sifu's children got sick with
the flu and the virus.

970
01:19:13.439 --> 01:19:17.017
So I went by,
scored some herbal medicines for them.

971
01:19:17.394 --> 01:19:20.813
I told them, lay off the dairy products.
Chill on the citric acid...

972
01:19:20.939 --> 01:19:22.431
...and they should feel a little better,
you know?

973
01:19:22.531 --> 01:19:25.608
Umm so, you a doctor now, or something?

974
01:19:25.943 --> 01:19:27.227
Yeah, yo. I told you, yo!

975
01:19:27.327 --> 01:19:30.405
I've been studying alternative medicine
for two years now, son.

976
01:19:30.573 --> 01:19:33.449
I mean, ancient healing techniques,
and all that, yo.

977
01:19:33.742 --> 01:19:36.945
Check this, yo. I even know
a certain surgical procedure

978
01:19:37.045 --> 01:19:38.997
that I can perform using a drill-gun.

979
01:19:39.415 --> 01:19:42.750
Electric drill-gun. I'm dead serious, yo.

980
01:19:43.002 --> 01:19:46.538
But, yo, my hands are nice from being a DJ,
you know what I mean?

981
01:19:46.638 --> 01:19:49.416
To me music and medicine all go together.

982
01:19:49.516 --> 01:19:53.303
It's like two planets revolving
around the same sun. So... bong-bong!

983
01:19:53.429 --> 01:19:55.046
- Want some tea?
- Yeah, splash me,

984
01:19:55.146 --> 01:19:56.806
It's all herbals man. No caffeine.

985
01:19:56.932 --> 01:20:01.185
That's what I'm talkin' about, no caffeine.
Caffeine is ridiculous right now, man.

986
01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.854
Tell me about it.

987
01:20:03.272 --> 01:20:06.149
That's what I'm saying, caffeine.
Caffeine leads to depression.

988
01:20:06.483 --> 01:20:08.067
Makes you all irritable.

989
01:20:08.235 --> 01:20:11.529
Have your heart beatin' fast,
faster heart rate, you know what I mean?

990
01:20:11.697 --> 01:20:15.065
And worse than anything, you drink
that coffee it gives you the shits.

991
01:20:15.165 --> 01:20:18.410
You know what I mean?
So I try to say away from that.

992
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:20.203
I'm off that shit anyway.

993
01:20:20.538 --> 01:20:22.664
- Crisp and clean, no caffeine.
- Yeah.

994
01:20:22.832 --> 01:20:26.335
- To liquid swords, family.
- Naw, to Bobby Digital.

995
01:20:26.794 --> 01:20:28.920
- Wu-Tang forever.
- Wu-Tang forever.

996
01:20:31.132 --> 01:20:32.841
Does anybody need more coffee?

997
01:20:33.134 --> 01:20:35.669
- Kitchen's closing.
- Naw man, we don't mess with caffeine.

998
01:20:35.769 --> 01:20:37.804
- You don't?
- Naw, I don't.

999
01:20:38.097 --> 01:20:40.557
Don't you know caffeine can
cause serious delirium?

1000
01:20:40.683 --> 01:20:42.851
- Delirium?
- Serious delirium.

1001
01:20:42.977 --> 01:20:47.606
Oh now you tell me.
Well that may be my problem. Delirium.

1002
01:20:52.528 --> 01:20:56.273
Aren't you Bill Murray, man?
That's... You Bill Murray?

1003
01:20:56.373 --> 01:21:00.494
Yeah, I'm Bill Murray. But ahh,
let's keep that just between us, alright?

1004
01:21:03.081 --> 01:21:04.498
Just between us.

1005
01:21:06.875 --> 01:21:09.960
And you guys are, ahh... related.

1006
01:21:10.379 --> 01:21:12.213
Yeah, we're Cousins. We're Family.

1007
01:21:12.339 --> 01:21:16.050
No, you're messing with me,
'cause you're both trouble makers.

1008
01:21:16.635 --> 01:21:19.220
- Trouble makers!
- The Wu-Tang clan.

1009
01:21:19.388 --> 01:21:20.721
Right, Wu-Tang Clan.

1010
01:21:21.848 --> 01:21:23.891
- You're GZA, the genius.
- That's right.

1011
01:21:24.017 --> 01:21:26.435
- And you're RZA...
- A.K. A...

1012
01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:29.695
Bobby Digital.

1013
01:21:29.795 --> 01:21:32.108
Yeah, he knows hip-hop, yo,
he knows hip-hop.

1014
01:21:32.234 --> 01:21:34.235
And you're Bill Murray.

1015
01:21:34.403 --> 01:21:38.739
Bill Groundhog Day,
Ghostbustin' ass Murray.

1016
01:21:38.907 --> 01:21:41.818
- Who ya' gonna call!
- I know that. Just don't tell anybody, alright.

1017
01:21:41.918 --> 01:21:44.320
What you mean, don't tell anybody,
Bill Murray? I mean...

1018
01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:45.788
people are going to come in here,
they're gonna see you.

1019
01:21:45.914 --> 01:21:47.665
You're Bill Murray. It's obvious.

1020
01:21:47.916 --> 01:21:50.167
Unless you're wearing
a disguise or something.

1021
01:21:51.795 --> 01:21:53.921
Well, I am wearing kind of a disguise.

1022
01:21:55.841 --> 01:21:57.716
Damn that's harsh, money.

1023
01:21:58.551 --> 01:22:00.711
You're a real caffeine junkie, aren't you.

1024
01:22:00.811 --> 01:22:02.929
Just keep it down, just between us.
Here, cheers.

1025
01:22:11.439 --> 01:22:13.314
You know, before I gave that up...

1026
01:22:13.566 --> 01:22:15.392
...I used to drink it every night,

1027
01:22:15.492 --> 01:22:18.653
every single night up
until it was time to go to sleep.

1028
01:22:18.863 --> 01:22:20.772
It was to make me dream faster.

1029
01:22:20.872 --> 01:22:24.576
You know, like when they flash
those cameras on those Indy 500 cars?

1030
01:22:24.827 --> 01:22:25.827
And they just...

1031
01:22:29.957 --> 01:22:32.333
That's how my dreams were.
Just whizzin' by.

1032
01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:35.295
- You're stupid, yo.
- He is stupid, isn't he?

1033
01:22:41.469 --> 01:22:45.388
I know a guy who freezes coffee.
Puts sticks in it...

1034
01:22:45.848 --> 01:22:47.466
Has himself a coffee popsicle.

1035
01:22:47.566 --> 01:22:49.516
- A caf' pop.
- A caf' pop.

1036
01:22:54.606 --> 01:22:55.731
Damn...

1037
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:57.767
That don't sound too good, Bill Murray!

1038
01:22:57.867 --> 01:23:01.361
It's not the flu or anything...
It's just smokers cough.

1039
01:23:03.573 --> 01:23:05.316
That's what I'm trying to tell you...
The nicotine, man.

1040
01:23:05.416 --> 01:23:07.826
Nicotine interferes with
the central nervous system.

1041
01:23:07.952 --> 01:23:09.745
Your respiratorial system,

1042
01:23:09.954 --> 01:23:13.332
I mean, in very small doses
it causes paralysis.

1043
01:23:17.754 --> 01:23:20.122
- Really?
- Yeah, really man.

1044
01:23:20.222 --> 01:23:22.883
I mean, just 50 milligrams alone...

1045
01:23:23.343 --> 01:23:25.594
...have been proven to be fatal
in a few minutes, man.

1046
01:23:25.845 --> 01:23:28.764
- How much is in one cigarette?
- 3 milligrams.

1047
01:23:29.015 --> 01:23:33.018
And did you know they also use nicotine
for an insecticide? To kill bugs.

1048
01:23:33.186 --> 01:23:35.229
It's good that it kills bugs, right?

1049
01:23:36.773 --> 01:23:38.357
Are you a bug, Bill Murray?

1050
01:23:40.943 --> 01:23:44.278
- Jesus, RZA, you sound like my doctor.
- He is a doctor...

1051
01:23:44.404 --> 01:23:47.907
Actually he specializes in
...alternative medicine.

1052
01:23:48.367 --> 01:23:51.327
That is, alternative to this planet.

1053
01:23:53.872 --> 01:23:59.043
Well... do me a favor and
don't tell anybody you saw me here.

1054
01:24:00.254 --> 01:24:03.381
- You can trust us Bill Murray.
- So Bill Murray.

1055
01:24:05.092 --> 01:24:06.676
You hiding out or something?

1056
01:24:07.219 --> 01:24:10.221
Yeah, sort of. Something like that.

1057
01:24:10.931 --> 01:24:12.974
Now I'm thinking it may be delirium.

1058
01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:14.976
- Serious delirium.
- Serious.

1059
01:24:15.686 --> 01:24:17.478
Well if you're on the low,

1060
01:24:17.855 --> 01:24:20.231
I got something
that'll help you with your disguise.

1061
01:24:20.816 --> 01:24:21.941
Take this.

1062
01:24:23.402 --> 01:24:24.777
- Use whatever you want.
- Oh geez...

1063
01:24:24.903 --> 01:24:26.563
Rock that, man. Stay on the low.

1064
01:24:26.663 --> 01:24:28.823
This is nice stuff.
You didn't have to do this. This is great.

1065
01:24:28.949 --> 01:24:30.524
A bag if items for you, Bill.

1066
01:24:30.624 --> 01:24:32.450
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

1067
01:24:32.577 --> 01:24:34.119
I really appreciate this.

1068
01:24:36.247 --> 01:24:37.247
This is great.

1069
01:24:39.834 --> 01:24:41.668
Doc, what could I do for this cough?

1070
01:24:41.878 --> 01:24:44.421
Damn I was just thinking about that.
Check this out.

1071
01:24:44.589 --> 01:24:48.633
- You get some hydrogen peroxide.
- We got that. For cuts and stuff.

1072
01:24:48.759 --> 01:24:51.845
Take fifty percent hydrogen peroxide,
fifty percent water.

1073
01:24:51.971 --> 01:24:54.923
You gargle with it.
Do not swallow, spit it out.

1074
01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:56.474
Don't swallow, Bill Murray.

1075
01:24:56.601 --> 01:24:59.686
And if that doesn't work... Try oven cleaner.

1076
01:25:00.730 --> 01:25:02.397
I got that in the back too.

1077
01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:05.017
- Thank you.
- Cool.

1078
01:25:05.117 --> 01:25:06.776
Thank you. I'm going to try it right now.

1079
01:25:10.531 --> 01:25:11.527
- Word.
- Word.

1080
01:25:11.627 --> 01:25:13.700
- Word man.
- Bill mother-fuckin' Murray!

1081
01:25:13.826 --> 01:25:15.118
It's crazy yo.

1082
01:25:16.537 --> 01:25:19.615
- Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo, Three o'clock.
- What's up?

1083
01:25:19.715 --> 01:25:22.374
I told Ghost to be here by 3 am.

1084
01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:25.753
Don't hold your breath on that one, man.
You know how it is waitin' on Ghost.

1085
01:25:25.962 --> 01:25:26.896
We'll be here all night.

1086
01:25:26.996 --> 01:25:28.205
Think we can smoke a blunt up in this joint?

1087
01:25:28.305 --> 01:25:30.966
Nah, it's hot up in here with the 5-0.

1088
01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:32.801
But we always smoke weed in here though.

1089
01:25:32.928 --> 01:25:35.346
That was until Dirt Dog done blew it up.

1090
01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.641
I told Deflon, never let Dirty
inside this spot, man.

1091
01:25:38.934 --> 01:25:40.559
So what's up, what you want to do, yo?

1092
01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:43.812
- Yo, let's slide to the 'udio.
- Hit the 'udio, right. Play some chess?

1093
01:25:43.939 --> 01:25:45.189
- Yeah.
- Alright then.

1094
01:25:45.315 --> 01:25:47.524
Is that the bill... for Murray?

1095
01:25:47.817 --> 01:25:50.444
- He don't need no money, yo.
- Hit him anyway.

1096
01:25:50.695 --> 01:25:51.946
Think I should tip him?

1097
01:25:55.992 --> 01:25:57.902
You think he's using the oven cleaner?

1098
01:25:58.002 --> 01:25:59.870
I don't know, but let's get
the fuck out of here.

1099
01:26:25.854 --> 01:26:27.480
Are you alright, Taylor?

1100
01:26:30.651 --> 01:26:32.235
No, not really.

1101
01:26:32.945 --> 01:26:34.028
What's up?

1102
01:26:35.864 --> 01:26:40.034
I don't know.
I feel so divorced from the world.

1103
01:26:40.661 --> 01:26:42.787
I've lost touch with the world.

1104
01:26:44.373 --> 01:26:47.458
Do you know that song by Mahler?

1105
01:26:48.752 --> 01:26:51.129
"I've Lost Track Of The World"?

1106
01:26:51.547 --> 01:26:52.547
No.

1107
01:26:53.882 --> 01:26:55.425
It's one of the most...

1108
01:26:56.343 --> 01:26:59.762
beautiful saddest songs ever written.

1109
01:27:02.391 --> 01:27:06.059
I can almost hear it now.

1110
01:27:11.399 --> 01:27:12.649
Can you hear it?

1111
01:28:03.533 --> 01:28:04.533
Oh...

1112
01:28:05.452 --> 01:28:08.954
It's gone now. But did you hear it?

1113
01:28:09.664 --> 01:28:10.790
I think so.

1114
01:28:14.461 --> 01:28:17.880
It resonated right through
the whole building.

1115
01:28:19.466 --> 01:28:21.050
Where are we?

1116
01:28:21.468 --> 01:28:25.868
In the Armory, Taylor.

1117
01:28:28.975 --> 01:28:32.645
It sounds so heavy and ponderous.

1118
01:28:34.106 --> 01:28:36.190
The Armory.

1119
01:28:37.317 --> 01:28:39.917
Nikola Tesla.

1120
01:28:41.613 --> 01:28:45.282
Perceived the Earth as a conductor...

1121
01:28:45.783 --> 01:28:49.327
...of acoustical resonance.

1122
01:28:52.665 --> 01:28:55.500
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1123
01:28:57.837 --> 01:28:59.587
Can you explain it to me?

1124
01:29:00.089 --> 01:29:01.289
No, not really.

1125
01:29:01.389 --> 01:29:06.344
I know. Let's pretend
this coffee is champagne.

1126
01:29:08.264 --> 01:29:09.681
Why would we do that?

1127
01:29:10.724 --> 01:29:12.976
Well, to celebrate life.

1128
01:29:14.478 --> 01:29:17.856
You know, like the rich, elegant people do.

1129
01:29:18.691 --> 01:29:20.859
The classy people.

1130
01:29:21.902 --> 01:29:26.531
I prefer coffee,
simple working man's coffee.

1131
01:29:26.699 --> 01:29:31.077
Oh, you're so provincial, Bill.

1132
01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:33.371
Do you know what your problem is?

1133
01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:35.540
What?

1134
01:29:37.417 --> 01:29:41.503
You have no joie de vivre.

1135
01:29:43.464 --> 01:29:44.464
I don't?

1136
01:29:46.384 --> 01:29:50.220
No, besides, this coffee is awful.

1137
01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:54.516
You're right, it really is bad isn't it?

1138
01:29:54.893 --> 01:29:56.560
Dreadful.

1139
01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.438
I propose a toast.

1140
01:30:00.857 --> 01:30:02.691
So, what should we toast.

1141
01:30:04.235 --> 01:30:07.196
Oh God... Paris.

1142
01:30:07.405 --> 01:30:10.816
In the 1920's. Josephine Baker...

1143
01:30:10.916 --> 01:30:12.701
The Moulin Rouge...

1144
01:30:13.203 --> 01:30:16.246
Qu'est-ce que c'est...
ca va... pa-pa...

1145
01:30:17.123 --> 01:30:21.835
And also, New York. In the 70's.

1146
01:30:22.045 --> 01:30:24.004
In the late 70's.

1147
01:30:24.797 --> 01:30:26.924
Really? Alright.

1148
01:30:27.425 --> 01:30:29.383
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1149
01:30:34.848 --> 01:30:36.766
Delicious, isn't it?

1150
01:30:38.143 --> 01:30:42.230
Ahh, champagne. Nectar of the Gods.

1151
01:30:43.982 --> 01:30:47.109
Is that all you're having for lunch,
is a coffee and a cigarette?

1152
01:30:47.236 --> 01:30:48.945
It's not very healthy.

1153
01:30:50.656 --> 01:30:52.323
We had lunch earlier.

1154
01:30:55.911 --> 01:30:57.119
We did?

1155
01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:03.042
We're on, like a break here.
A coffee break here.

1156
01:31:04.544 --> 01:31:06.587
Oh, how depressing.

1157
01:31:07.756 --> 01:31:09.632
How long is our break, anyway?

1158
01:31:09.925 --> 01:31:13.469
About 10 minutes,
and it's nearly over now.

1159
01:31:17.349 --> 01:31:19.182
Say it isn't true.

1160
01:31:21.978 --> 01:31:24.312
- Well...
- What?

1161
01:31:24.855 --> 01:31:28.316
I asked you to say it isn't true.

1162
01:31:28.526 --> 01:31:30.151
Say what isn't true?

1163
01:31:31.654 --> 01:31:34.489
Oh, never, never, never mind.

1164
01:31:35.741 --> 01:31:38.493
Anyway, I have to have a nap.

1165
01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:44.958
So, call me when the break is over.

1166
01:31:47.003 --> 01:31:51.881
Well you have like 2 minutes or less
for your nap.

1167
01:32:09.650 --> 01:32:11.049
Taylor?
